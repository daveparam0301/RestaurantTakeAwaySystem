# RestaurantTakeAwaySystem
This is a project involving a Restaurant takeaway system.
As a user, you can create orders (pizza and/or pasta) with multiple available topping types.
Each topping has different cost, and meal type (Meat, vegetarian or vegan).
Additionally a you can print out details of orders (Customer names, numbers, address, food items, and total price)
Finally you can deliver existing orders, where the order which has been created first will be served first.
